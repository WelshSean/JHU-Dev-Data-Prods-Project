## Overview

* mtcars is one of the test datasets that can be loaded into R
* It was extracted from the 1974 Motor trend US Magazine
* A useful, manageable dataset for exploration
* This application sets out to allow the user to evaluate linear models for mtcars
* It also allows the user to pick which of the covariants  are included in the model



--- .class #id 

## Features in the mtcars Dataset

```{r  echo=FALSE}
data("mtcars")
str(mtcars)
```

## Why build this Application?

* The application could serve as a useful learning aid for statistics students studying Linear Models
* Provides a convenient way to play with a linear model for people who are interested
* Provides a Minimal Viable Product(MVP) from which we could iterate to build a much more fully featured, useful application.

## The Problem that this application solves

The application solves the linear model problem using the lm function in R. \

The tickboxes can be used to build formula that the lm function expects of the form y ~ a+b+c. 

$$
y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{i} \cdots  + \beta_{n}X_{n} + \epsilon
$$

The application supplies the user with $\beta_{0}, \beta{1} \cdots \beta_{n}$

## Further work

* Ability to select other models
* Ability to toggle verbose output to see errors, p-values, etc
* Ability to use model to carry out predictions.
